This guide gets you acquainted with the Arquillian Forge plugin. After reading this guide, you'll be able to:

* Install the Arquillian plugin into your Forge installation
* Use the plugin to add the Arquillian infrastructure to a Maven-based Java Project
* Generate a component and cooresponding Arquillian test
* Execute the Arquillian test on multiple containers without manual configuration

You'll be performing many of the same steps described in the "Getting Started":getting_started guide, only you'll be letting Forge handle the dirty work. We've designed this guide to be a fast read to get you started even quicker than ever before.
